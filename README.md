# Issues:

## 18/10/24
- Unable to test the model at all, I've tried running it but either it takes forever, or my data limit on BITS Wi-Fi gets exhausted.
- The code looks convincing enough, although it's majorly AI generated. I've tried understanding what each line does but I'm still underconfident due to lack of testing.
- Not entirely sure if my laptop has 2 GPUs of 14 GB each (pretty sure I only have 1, so most probably I won't be able to test the code).
- Still not entirely familiar with all the libraries and functions used, but that shouldn't be the case for long.
- On the bright side, I understand what the code is trying to do, the "how" is what will take some time to figure out (thankfully it's Python so I'll be fine)
